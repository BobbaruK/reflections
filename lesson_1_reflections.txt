How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?
    the difference between them... wtf??

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?
	maybe because you can spot de difference between them

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create 
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
Google Docs does?
	because you can be more "ordonat"
