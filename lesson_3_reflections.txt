1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
	i dont know yet...

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	because i might change my mind about a change :)

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
	forks is used only on gitHub
	clones is used to clone from gitHub to local
	and branches are used both local and on gitHub

4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?
	you can diff between them
